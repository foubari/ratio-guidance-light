> **Status:** Research project - simplified implementation

## Overview

This is a lightweight, simplified version of the [ratio_guidance](https://github.com/fouad/ratio_guidance) project. It provides a streamlined implementation of density-ratio (PMI) guided diffusion for multimodal generation.

The goal of this repository is to provide a cleaner, more accessible codebase for experimenting with ratio-based guidance techniques in diffusion models.

## Key Differences from Full Version

- Simplified codebase structure
- Focus on core functionality
- Reduced dependencies
- Easier to understand and modify

## Installation

Coming soon.
